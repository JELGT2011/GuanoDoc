GuanoDoc
========

The batshit insane document system.

GuanoDoc eschews any pretence of regularity or even decidability in its
documents, instead preferring to allow maximum flexibility of expression
through a completely [unrestricted grammar].

To try it, first make sure that you have Python 3 and the `pip` tool.
Then you can run `./guano sample.guano` and compare it to the contents
of `sample.guano`.

Don't try to use it for anything important, because that would just be silly.
